# Sentinel-Building-Segmentation
In this project i build a pipeline to classify building locations in cities from satellite images. The trained model(s) classify if pixels contain buildings or not. 

How to run the code:
Open the folder in jupyter notebook or a similar environment that allows running ipynb
files, then running each cell individually to get the results:
Download_Files.ipynb for Task 1
Pipeline.ipynb for Task 1.2 and 1.3
Data_Augmentation.ipynb for Task 1.4
